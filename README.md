ADD RIDER 

 - If we want to add a rider , we can select the option 1 , and once we provide the required details , it will add the new rider and gives us the confirmation and displays the newly added rider . Since Rider is available , it will automatically tries to assign the packages .( Here we are storing the co-ordinates of the driver location , so that we can use it if we want to assign the riders based on the location in future ) .
